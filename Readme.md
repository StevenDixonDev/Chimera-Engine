# JS-Games

I remember really wanting to learn how to make games when I was younger. This repo chronicles my expereince with game developement in JS. I wanted to start out with simple concepts and work my way into some fully functioning games. I also wanted to learn these concepts without using any game development libraries. 

## Things I expect to learn

- [ ] Collission Detection
- [ ] Resource management
- [ ] Game Loops
- [ ] Game States
- [ ] Event management
- [ ] Cameras
- [ ] And more

## How do you expect to learn this stuff? Books or tutorials

I really haven't decided, I really want to code most of this from scratch.

## Expectations

I expect that by the end of this I will have a good concept of how games work theoritically, and have a basis that if I ever want to create a game that I will have a toolkit at my disposal.
