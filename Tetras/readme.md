# Tetras 

This game was the first project I took on. I learned that for such a simple game things can be very complex. my approach for this was class based becuase I beleived that it would be my best chance of scaling for future game projects. 

## What I learned

- Game loops with request animation frames
- class management
- simple collission for matrices
- some resource management

## What will I bring forward

I plan on carrying my structure forward, I enjoyed building out the scene management that allows me to switch between scenes. I imagine this is how other games switch from a title screen to the actual game.
